## Introduction

A few paragraphs which (i) motivate problem importance & relevance (supported by relevant literature, if any), (ii) describe project goals and how such goals address the problem, as well as (iii) a high-level roadmap of the proposed methodology, and (iv) other relevant information for the reader. See project rubric for details.

Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood. There are different types of diabetes, but Type II diabetes mellitus is the most common. If left untreated, Type II diabetes can cause major health complications, including heart attack, kidney failure, stroke, and eye damage. In fact, Type II diabetes was the 7th leading cause of death in 2019; and unfortunately, its prevalence is rapidly increasing worldwide (CDC). According to the CDC, more than 37 million people in the United States have diabetes, and 1 in 5 people are unaware that they have it. Furthermore, approximately 96 million Americans (1 in 3) have prediabetes, and a shocking 80% of those Americans are unaware of their risk (CDC). Type II diabetes and prediabetes often begin as silent conditions, and so they often go undiagnosed for years with no clear symptoms, until serious health complications develop.

Although diabetes is an irreversible disease, it is largely preventable. The risk of developing diabetes can be reduced significantly through early detection of prediabetes and lifestyle interventions. While type 2 diabetes and prediabetes can be easily diagnosed through glucose blood testing, many people fail to test regularly. Therefore, evaluating diabetes risk through metrics other than glucose levels can prove to be extraordinarily valuable.

The prevalence of type II diabetes varies by age, education, income, other social determinants of health, and a variety of health indicators/factors regularly screened for at routine check ups. We aim to build an ML model to (1) identify individuals with diabetes or prediabetes, who could otherwise go undiagnosed, and (2) indicate individuals who show early signs (or are at risk) for prediabetes. Clinicians can then implement this model as a part of annual physical exams. If a clinician sees a result that indicates diabetes risk, then they can proceed with a glucose level test to determine whether or not there is a diagnosis. If there is a diagnosis they can proceed with the medical protocols/advice established. However, what separates our model, even if there is no diagnosis (for diabetes or prediabetes aka no extreme blood sugar levels yet), the model still indicated the patient was at risk, and so the patient can then be proactive in lowering their risk for pre diabetes / type II diabetes, and implement preventative measures. 

 
## Data

Our data was obtained from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is a health-related telephone survey collected annually by the CDC and gathers responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors and chronic health conditions. For this project, a CSV of the dataset available on Kaggle was used. This original dataset contains responses from 441,455 individuals and has 330 features. The dataset originally had 330 features, but based on diabetes disease research regarding factors influencing diabetes disease and other chronic health conditions, only 21 select features are included in this analysis. After removing observations with missing values, we were left with 253,680 observations in our dataset.

The response variable is a binary indicator of whether someone does not have diabetes (0), or they do have diabetes or prediabetes (1). 

There are 21 predictors: most are binary indicators, and some are discrete data such as age, BMI, health over the past month, etc. All of these predictors are noninvasive measurements commonly taken in medical settings, and can easily be collected by doctors at physical checkups to be able to run our predictive algorithm in order to determine diabetes risk. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
predictor.table = rbind(c("High BP", "Has high blood pressure", "Binary"),
    c("High cholesterol", "Ever had high cholesterol", "Binary"),
    c("Cholesterol check", "Cholesterol check within past five years", "Binary"),
    c("BMI", "Body Mass Index", "Discrete (1-98)"),
    c("Smoker", "Smoked at least 100 cigarettes in entire life", "Binary"),
    c("Stroke", "Ever had a stroke", "Binary"),
    c("Heart disease", "Ever had coronary heart disease", "Binary"),
    c("Physical activity", "Exercised within the past 30 days", "Binary"),
    c("Fruits", "Consume fruit 1 or more times per day", "Binary"),
    c("Vegetables", "Consume vegetables 1 or more times per day", "Binary"),
    c("Heavy alcohol use", "Men: >14 drinks weekly, Women: >7 drinks weekly", "Binary"),
    c("Any healthcare", "Has any kind of health care coverage", "Binary"),
    c("No doctor (cost)", "Needed doctor in past year but couldn't go due to cost", "Binary"),
    c("General health", "Scale of 1-5", "Discrete (1-5)"),
    c("Mental health", "Days of poor mental health in past 30 days", "Discrete (1-30)"),
    c("Physical health", "Physical illness or injury in past 30 days", "Discrete (1-30)"),
    c("Difficulty walking", "Difficulty walking or climbing stairs", "Binary"),
    c("Sex", "Male or Female", "Binary"),
    c("Age", "Which age group (18-24, 24-30,...)", "Discrete (1-13)"),
    c("Education", "Highest level of education (None, elementary,...)", "Discrete (1-6)"),
    c("Income", "Annual income bracket (<$10k, $10k-$15k,...)", "Discrete (1-8)"))

colnames(predictor.table) = c("Predictor", "Description", "Data Type")

kable(predictor.table, caption = "Predictor Descriptions") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size=10, latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```


This dataset is sufficient in meeting our project goals since it has a significantly large number of observations (253,680), and a large number of predictors that can all easily be measured noninvasively in clinical settings.

**TODO:** TALK ABOUT EDA


## Methodology

Discussion & justification of model choice and features, and how the proposed model(s) fully addresses project goals. Any “downstream” uses of the model (e.g., for prediction, optimization, ranking) should be discussed in detail here. See project rubric for details.

#### Inference

#### Prediction


## Results

Statistical analyses of the fitted model(s), and a translation of these findings into meaningful & understandable conclusions for the target audience (e.g., engineers, business managers, policy-makers, etc). See project rubric for details.
